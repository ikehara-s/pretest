Which three are true about thresholds, metrics, and server-generated alerts? (Choose three.)
A. All metrics are instance related.
B. Cleared stateful alerts are displayed by querying DBA_ALERT_HISTORY.
C. A space usage management alert is automatically cleared after the underlying problem is resolved.
D. They are generated by SMON when a tablespace is 97% full.
E. Metrics are statistical counts for a specific unit.
F. STATISTICS_LEVEL must be set to ALL to generate alerts.

[janw]
D incorrect ==> MMON

[janw]
B correct
DBA_ALERT_HISTORY describes a time-limited history of alerts which are no longer outstanding.

[janw]
C correct
Most alerts, such as the Out of Space alert, are cleared automatically when the cause of the problem disappears.

[janw]
F incorrect ==> typical is sufficient

[janw]
correct: BCE

[Jatindra]
Reference Student guide:
Threshold alerts are also referred to as stateful alerts which are automatically cleared when an alert condition clears.
Stateful alerts appear in DBA_OUTSTANDING_ALERTS and when cleared go to DBA_ALERT_HISTORY.

While backing up to an SBT channel, you determine that the read phase of your compressed Recovery Manager (RMAN) incremental level 0 backup is a bottleneck.
FORCE LOGGING is enabled for the database.
Which two could improve read performance? (Choose two.)
A. Increase the size of tape I/O buffers.
B. Disable FORCE LOGGING for the database.
C. Increase the size of the database buffer cache.
D. Enable asynchronous disk I/O.
E. Increase the level of RMAN multiplexing.

[janw]
CE correct

[janw]
You can improve performance by increasing the degree of multiplexing used for backing up.
This increases the rate at which RMAN fills tape buffers, which makes it more likely that buffers are sent to the media manager fast enough to maintain streaming.

[janw]
When a channel reads from or writes to disk, the I/O is either synchronous I/O or asynchronous I/O.
When the disk I/O is synchronous, a server process can perform only one task at a time.
When the disk I/O is asynchronous, a server process can begin an I/O operation and then perform other work while waiting for the I/O to complete.
RMAN can also begin multiple I/O operations before waiting for the first to complete.
When reading from an ASM disk group, you should use asynchronous disk I/O if possible.
Also, if a channel reads from a raw device managed with a volume manager, then asynchronous disk I/O also works well.
Some operating systems support native asynchronous disk I/O.
The database takes advantage of this feature if it is available.

[janw]
DE correct
C = incorrect, rman does not use database buffer cache

C. to include specific user tablespaces only when relocating a PDB
D. to specify the list of user tablespaces to include when moving a non-CDB to a PDB
E. to exclude a temp tablespace when plugging in a PDB
F. to specify the list of tablespaces to include when creating a PDB from the CDB seed

[janw]
B. to exclude all tablespaces except SYSTEM, SYSAUX, and TEMP when plugging in a PDB
D. to specify the list of user tablespaces to include when moving a non-CDB to a PDB

When you drop a table, the database does not immediately remove the space associated with the table.
The database renames the table and places it and any associated objects in a recycle bin, where, in case the table was dropped in error, it can be recovered at a later time.
This feature is called Flashback Drop, and the FLASHBACK TABLE statement is used to restore the table

F. configuring the OS for Oracle Automatic Storage Management shared storage access

[janw]
When installed, the Oracle Preinstallation RPM does the following:
Automatically downloads and installs any additional RPM packages needed for installing Oracle Grid Infrastructure and Oracle Database, and resolves any dependencies
Creates an oracle user, and creates the oraInventory (oinstall) and OSDBA (dba) groups for that user
As needed, sets sysctl.conf settings, system startup parameters, and driver parameters to values based on recommendations from the Oracle Preinstallation RPM program
Sets hard and soft resource limits
Sets other recommended parameters, depending on your kernel version
Sets numa=off in the kernel for Linux x86_64 machines.

Which two are true about common objects? (Choose two.)
A. They can be created only in CDB$ROOT.
B. They can be only metadata-linked in an application container.
C. They can exist in user-defined schemas only in application containers.
D. They can exist in CDB$ROOT and an application root.
E. They can be extended data-linked in CDB$ROOT.
F. They can be created only in an application root.

[janw]
With Oracle 12c Oracle introduced the concept of common objects which avoids redundancy of metadata and data.
Which makes CDB maintenance and up-gradation easy.
Common objects exist in Oracle-supplied schemas and therefore cannot be user-defined.
In the Application container, we can create metadata-linked or data-linked common objects.

[janw]
correct = cf

[Jatindra]
EF is correct .

[Jatindra]
sorry E is not correct..
Got below from student guide:
D. is correct:
Reference: Student Guide:
Common objects exist in oracle supplied schemas in the CDB root.
Users can create application common objects in application root.
The common object is visible to all application PDBs within the application container when the application PDBs have been synchronized with the application root.
Below are from documentation:
A common object is defined in either the CDB root or an application root, and can be referenced using metadata links or object links.
A local object is every object that is not a common object.
Database-supplied common objects are defined in CDB$ROOT and cannot be changed.
Oracle Database does not support creation of common objects in CDB$ROOT.

[Jatindra]
Correct answer is C,D

[IOracle]
A - is false - they cannot be created in cdbroot
"Oracle Database does not support creation of common objects in CDB$ROOT. "
https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/multi/overview-of-the-multitenant-architecture.html#GUID-8B4B4F8B-1C2B-42C3-BE77-E9AA25CA397A
B - not correct, they can only be metadata linked nd data linked
C - they do not exist only in "application container"
D - is correct there are common objects ( CDB$ROOT) and application common objects (application root)
E - is false, the extended data linkd common objects are only located in application root
F - is correct . They can be created in application containers

[taotsumiau]
F is not correct, because not ONLY in application containers.
It can create in application root and cdb$root.

[samm]
E and F is correct .
E. To create common objects, connect to an application root, and then execute a CREATE
statement that specifies a sharing attribute.
F. A metadata link is a dictionary object that supports referring to, and granting
privileges on, common metadata shared by all PDBs in the application container

[samm]
E is correct. extended data linked in both CDB$root and application root, Just meta data would be in application root for all common object.
F is correct. An application common object is a common object created within an application in an application root.
B is wrong. Common objects are either data-linked or metadata-linked.
A is wrong. as mention F is correct.
C is wrong. Common object can be shared across multiple PDB in application container

Which two are true about server-generated alerts? (Choose two.)
A. Stateful alerts must be created by a DBA after resolving the problem.
B. Stateless alerts can be purged manually from the alert history.
C. Stateless alerts can be cleared manually.
D. Stateless alerts are automatically cleared.
E. Stateful alerts are purged automatically from the alert history.

[janw]
For metric alert event types, an event (metric alert) is raised based on the metric threshold values.
These metric alert events are called stateful alerts.
For those metric alert events that are not tied to the state of a monitored system (for example, snapshot too old, or resumable session suspended ), these alerts are called stateless alerts.
Because stateless alerts are not cleared automatically, they need to be cleared manually.

[janw]
correct: BC

[Jatindra]
Correct Ans: B,C
Student Guide:
Except for the tablespace space usage metric, which is database related, the other metrics are instance related.
Threshold alerts are also referred to as stateful alerts which are automatically cleared when an alert condition clears.
Stateful alert appears in DBA_OUTSTANDING_ALERTS and when cleared go to DBA_ALERT_HISTORY.
Other server-generated alerts correspond to specific database events such as ORA-* errors,
"Snapshot too old" errors, Recovery Area Low on Free Space, Resumable Session Suspended. These are non threshold based alerts, also referred to as stateless alerts.
Stateless alerts go directly to the History table.
Most alerts (such as "Out of Space") are cleared automatically when the cause of the problem disappears.
However, other alerts (such as generic alert log errors) are sent to you for notification and must be acknowledged by you.
After taking the corrective measures, you acknowledge an alert by clearing or purging it.
Clearing an alert sends the alert to the Alert History which is accessible from Monitoring sub menu.
Purging an alert removes it from the Alert History.

[Jatindra]
Student Guide:
A duplicate database is a copy of your target database.
With the FOR STANDBY clause, it keeps the same unique database identifier(DBID); If FOR STANDBY not specified it creates a new DBID.
The duplicate database can include the same content or only a subset from the source database. It can be in the same host or a separate host.
The principal work of the duplication is performed by the auxiliary channels.These channels correspond to a server session on the auxiliary instance on the destination host for backup based duplication.
For active database duplication the target channels perform the work of pushing data file copies to the auxiliary instance (if number of allocated target channels is greater than the number of allocated auxiliary channels).

D. After the change, any user with the required privilege can create an undo tablespace in the PDBs.
E. Undo tablespaces existing in PDBs must be dropped before the change.
F. After the change, each existing PDB has to be reopened for the new undo mode to take effect.

[monad2006]
I think -> BF

[Jatindra]
C is correct.
Student guide:
You can set a CDB in local UNDO mode either at CDB creation or by altering the CDB property.
When the database property LOCAL_UNDO_ENABLE is FALSE, which is the default, there is only one UNDO tablespace that is created in the CDB root, and that is shared by all containers.
When LOCAL_UNDO_ENABLE is TRUE, every container in the CDB uses local undo and each PDB must have its own local UNDO tablespace. To maintain ease of management and provisioning, UNDO tablespace creation happens automatically and does not require any action from the user. When a PDB is opened and an UNDO tablespace is not available, its automatically created.

[Jatindra]
Correct Answer B,C

[dacoben415lywenw]

[Jatindra]
Correct Answer: B,E (not 100% sure)
Below link may clear this confusion :
https://mikedietrichde.com/2016/10/21/gather-fixed-objects-stats-in-pdbs-as-well/#:~:text=Yes%2C%20you'll%20have%20to,independently%20from%20the%20CDB%24ROOT.&text=Oracle%20Database%20automatically%20gathers%20fixed,Automatic%20Optimizer%20Statistics%20Collection%E2%80%9C).
Conclusion
Yes, you’ll have to gather fixed objects stats in PDBs independently from the CDB$ROOT.
But generally in Oracle Database 12c the Automatic Statistics Gathering job will take care on Fixed Objects Stats as well (see here). In a Multitenant environment you just may have to take care to unfold your default maintenance windows as otherwise this will happen in all PDBs at the same time generating plenty of noise on your system.
Oracle Database automatically gathers fixed object statistics as part of automated statistics gathering if they have not been previously collected (see “Controlling Automatic Optimizer Statistics Collection“).

Student Guide:

PDB SYSTEM or UNDO Tablespace Recovery:
The CDB and all other PDBs can be left opened.
1. Connect to PDB
2. Shutdown abort the PDB, if its not automatically done.
sqlplus sys@sales_pdb as sysdba
sql> SHUTDOWN ABORT;
OR
ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE CLOSE ABORT;
rman target sys@slaes_pdb
rman> restore database;
rman> recover database;
rman> alter pluggable database sales_pdb open;

[Jatindra]
Closing a PDB with the ABORT mode forcefully closes it without bringing down the entire CDB instance.
It is successful regardless of the states of the actual PDB datafiles.
The operation requires you to be connected to the PDB, have the ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE system privilege and have the CDB in ARCHIVELOG mode.
If the datafile that is missing or corrupted belogs to PDB and more specifically to the SYSTEM or UNDO tablespace, the PDB must shutdown in ABORT mode.
The health checker can automatically detects there is a severe failure and aborts the PDB.
A PDB, tablespace or datafile media recovery is required before the PDB can be reopened.
In case the PDB is the application root of an application container, other datafiles in the application PDBs may have to be restored and recovered as well.

[taotsumiau]
AB is right

[veginha]
I think the word "must" in B makes it wrong, is it posible to restore from cdb while in mount state?
It sems to me that C is a little more accuracy

E. These backups can be written to disk or SBT.

[monad2006]
I think: AC

[Jatindra]
Correct Answer: D,E
The RMAN command backup recovery area allows you to back up all files required to restore the database via RMAN from a recovery area to an sbt (tape) device.

[Jatindra]
File Type Notes
Control file One copy of the control file is created in the flash recovery area when the database is created.
Archived redo logs When you configure the flash recovery area, the parameter log_archive_dest_10 is automatically configured, and archived redo logs are archived to that destination, as well as any other archive log destinations.
Flashback logs Flashback logs are stored in the flash recovery area, if it is defined.
Control file autobackups The default location for the RMAN control file autobackups is the flash recovery area, if it is defined.

[Jatindra]
RMAN datafile copies The default location for the RMAN datafile copies is the flash recovery area, if it is defined.
RMAN backup and other related files The default location for the RMAN files in general (backup-set pieces, etc.) is the flash recovery area, if it is defined.
Databases should be in Archive log mode for flashback recovery.
If a flash recovery area is configured, archival is enabled automatically and LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_10 is configured to flash recovery area.
If no default location for LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST is provided, then flash recovery area is used to store the archive logs.
A single flash recovery area can be shared between more than one databases.

[Jatindra]
https://blog.toadworld.com/rman_-_using_the_flash_recovery_area

[ald85]
I think AC. The BACKUP RECOVERY FILES command backs up all recovery files, even if the are not in the FRA.

[you1234]
https://blog.toadworld.com/rman_-_using_the_flash_recovery_area
The backup recovery files command must also go to an sbt device and cannot go to disk.
Hence E is wrong.
There is a second command, backup recovery files, that backs up all recovery files that are on the disk, wherever they may be (in flash recovery areas or otherwise).
Hence D is wrong.
Correct looks like AC.

[dacoben415lywenw]
ACE possible

While backing up to the Oracle Fast Recovery Area (FRA), you determined the backup is taking too long and suspect a performance bottleneck.
Which three are true about diagnosing and tuning these problems? (Choose three.)
A. If an RMAN BACKUP VALIDATE command takes roughly the same time as an actual backup, then both read and write I/O are likely bottlenecks.
B. Setting DBWR_IO_SLAVES to a non zero value can improve backup performance when using synchronous I/O.
C. If an RMAN BACKUP VALIDATE command takes noticeably less than an actual backup, then write I/O is a likely bottleneck.
D. If an RMAN BACKUP VALIDATE command takes roughly the same time as an actual backup, then read I/O is a likely bottleneck.
E. Data files with a high value in V$BACKUP_SYNC_IO.DISCRETE_BYTES_PER_SECOND are a potential performance bottleneck when synchronous I/O is used.
F. Setting DBWR_IO_SLAVES to a non zero value can improve backup performance when using asynchronous I/O/

All are valid, but i think BCE is correct because you don't require the file_name_convert in option "A" just pdb_file_name_convert, don't need pdb_file_name_convert in "D" just omf, also don't require file_name_convert in option "F" just omf.

Which three are true about managing memory components in an Oracle database instance? (Choose three.)
A. With Automatic Shared Memory Management, the database instance can increase the Large Pool size by reducing the Shared Pool size.
B. With Automatic Memory Management, the database instance can increase the System Global Area size by reducing the Program Global Area size.
C. Automatically tuned and resized System Global Area components will always revert to their initial sizes after an instance restart.
D. Automatic Memory Management must be used together with locking the System Global Area into physical memory.
E. With Automatic Shared Memory Management, the database instance can increase the Program Global Area size by reducing the System Global Area size.
F. On Line Transaction Processing systems often use less Program Global Area than Decision Support Systems.

in AMM the instance exchanges memory between the SGA and the instance PGA as needed (B is correct)
In ASMM the instance automatically distributes this memory among the various SGA components (JUST SGA) (A is correct, E incorrect)
After a restart the instance return to the SGA values before the shutdown (not the initial values) (C incorrect)
https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/admin/managing-memory.html#GUID-8F54391B-D42A-4FDA-9D12-E1F81FD113EA
F is also correct:
For OLTP systems, the PGA memory typically makes up a small fraction of the available memory, leaving most of the remaining memory for the SGA.
For DSS systems running large, memory-intensive queries, PGA memory can typically use up to 70% of the available memory.

A database is configured in ARCHIVELOG mode.
Full RMAN backups are taken and no backup to trace has been taken of the control file.
A media failure has occurred.
In which two scenarios is complete recovery possible? (Choose two.)
A. when any archived log from, before, or after the most recent backup is corrupt.
B. after losing all copies of the control file
C. after losing an archived log from after the most recent backup
D. after losing an archived log from before the most recent backup
E. after losing the SYSTEM tablespace

[veginha]
i think D and E are correct.
If you lose any archive from after the backup, you can't do a complete recovery, so A and C are discarted, also you can't mount the database if you don't have a valid control file. (not B)

[taotsumiau]
what if the questions is incomplete recovery, what do you think the answer?
I think C,D are correct, what's your idea?

[veginha]
well if the question was "incomplete recovery" then i think that you only need the control file and the backup, so it could be possible to do the incomplete recovery in A,C,D, and also E, fortunately they ask for the complete recovery scenario, so i'm going with D, E :)

ACF is correct.

[dacoben415lywenw]
F doesn't seem to be correct. i
In the same doc:
If there is not enough disk space to grow, then DBUA prompts you to create space (by adding more datafiles).
DBUA does not automatically add new datafiles because DBUA cannot determine where to create the files.

The Prerequisite Checks window opens.
DBUA analyzes the databases, performing pre-upgrade checks and displaying warnings as necessary.
The following is a list of examples of DBUA checks and actions DBUA performs on the database:
Empty database recycle bin.
Identify invalid objects.
Identify deprecated and desupported initialization parameters.
Identify time zone data file version.

Step 6: The Select Options Configuration window displays:
...
Recompile Invalid Objects During Post Upgrade.
This option recompiles all invalid PL/SQL modules after the upgrade is complete. If you do not have DBUA recompile invalid objects in its post-upgrade phase, then you must manually recompile invalid objects after the database is upgraded.
...
Set User Tablespaces to Read Only During the Upgrade.
Select this option to prevent user attempts to write to tablespaces during the upgrade.

D. The MAPTABLE table is a metadata-linked table.
E. A container map exists for the REVENUE table, but is not enabled.
F. The REVENUE table partitions are not pruned across the PDBs automatically.

[veginha]
C and E
-Use a container map to partition the data in metadata-linked objects. Container maps partition data in application PDBs based on a commonly-used column.
-The map object is the partitioned table. The names of the partitions in the map table match the names of the application PDBs in the application container.
The metadata-linked object is not physically partitioned at the table level, but it can be queried using the partitioning strategy used by the container map.
-In addition, you can enable the CONTAINERS_DEFAULT attribute for a table or view in an application root. When this attribute is enabled, the CONTAINERS clause is used for queries and DML statements on the database object by default, and the CONTAINERS clause does not need to be specified in the SQL statements.
To enable the CONTAINERS_DEFAULT attribute for a table or view in an application root, run the an ALTER TABLE or ALTER VIEW statement with the ENABLE CONTAINERS_DEFAULT clause.

Which three are true about backup, restore, and recovery operations done without using Recovery Manager (RMAN)? (Choose three.)
A. Backing up a database in NOARCHIVELOG mode using O/S utilities requires that the database instance be started and the dataabse be in the MOUNT state.
B. Backing up a database in ARCHIVELOG mode using O/S utilities requires that the database instance be started and the database be in MOUNT state.
C. An Oracle database can be restored from backup files copied using O/S utilities.
D. Oracle data file backups, copied using an O/S utility, can be added to the RMAN catalog as IMAGE COPIES.
E. Backing up a database in NOARCHIVELOG mode using O/S utilities requires that the database instance be shut down.
F. Oracle archive log backups, copied using an O/S utility, can be added to the RMAN catalog as a backup set.
G. Backing up a database in ARCHIVELOG mode using O/S utilities requires that the database instance be started and the database be in OPEN state.

I think A B D are correct, in mount state the datafiles are closed, so you can take offline backups

[ald85]
ARCHIVELOG mode must be OPEN -> B is incorrect and G correct.

[julica]
A,B,G are not right because the question is telling us 'without RMAN'.
To put it in mount/open or so, are necessary only in case of using RMAN.
Otherwise, using OS Utils, DB must be closed or maximum in NOMOUNT state.

[mik8440p]
I think C,E,G is correct -
E - before mount you must shutdown

You can make a whole database backup if a database is operating in either ARCHIVELOG or NOARCHIVELOG mode.
If you run the database in NOARCHIVELOG mode, however, then the backup must be consistent; that is, you must shut down the database cleanly before the backup. "

A Oracle Grid only supports out-of-place upgrades

[julica]
F is incorrect because in case of 'opatchauto', root is the user that can run the command.
So, I think B is right because is about new version, that means OutOfPlace Upgrade.
Upgrade can reuse an existing Oracle Base (C).

A. after losing a SYSAUX tablespace data file
B. after losing all members of an INACTIVE online redo log group
C. after losing all members of the CURRENT online redo log group
D. after losing all copies of the control file
E. after losing an UNDO tablespace that is in use

[veginha]
I think C and E

[you1234]
C & D is correct.
C &
D is correct because if you lose all control the required incomplete recovery. if incomplete recovery then db must be open in resetlog option.
E: undo tablespace. >> (Incorrect)

D: (correct see the details)

[veginha]
You are right about the undo, and also the resetlog after restore the control file, but even in that case, you can do a complete recovery while you have all the redo and archives (check link)
..., I don't know which other option could be correct, so I suppose that "D" its the more accuracy.
https://web.stanford.edu/dept/itss/docs/oracle/10gR2/backup.102/b14191/rcmrecov003.htm

[taotsumiau]
I agreed C&D too!

[julica]
(E) Undo is used for rolling BW DB. And that is useful when you want to do PITR.
But in this case, UNDO does not have any role.
Incomplete recovery uses a backup to produce a noncurrent version of the database. In other words, you do not apply all of the redo records generated after the most recent backup.
You usually perform incomplete recovery of the whole database in the following situations:
Media failure destroys some or all of the online redo logs.
A user error causes data loss, for example, a user inadvertently drops a table.
You cannot perform complete recovery because an archived redo log is missing.
You lose your current control file and must use a backup control file to open the database.
In our case the qestion said there is not backup to trace for control file. So, exist a backup of CF included.
My opinion is C and D.


//=============================================================================
// 63
//=============================================================================

Which two are true about instance recovery? (Choose two.)
A. It is not possible if an archived log is missing.
B. It is performed automatically after the database is opened; however, blocks requiring recovery are not available until they are recovered.
C. Setting FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET to a lower value reduces instance recovery time by causing dirty buffers to be written to disk more frequently, thereby reducing the number of I/Os needed during instance recovery.
D. It is performed by the Recovery Writer (RVWR) background process.
E. Setting FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET to a higher value reduces instance recovery time by causing the log writer to write more frquently, thereby reducing the number of I/Os needed during instance recovery.
F. It is performed automatically while the database remains in MOUNT state. Then the database is opened.

[veginha]
CF are my choices

[ald85]
BC Instance recovey occurs when ALTER DATABASE OPEN not before.

[veginha]
well i'm not so sure about it:
You are right about the instance recovery begins after "alter database open" is executed but that doesn't mean that the database is already open when the recovery starts.
The instance recovery is executed in 2 steps, rollforward and rollback and the database is open just after the rollforward is completed.
So i think that is not accuracy to tell that the instance recovery is performed after the database is open.
What do you thik?
Here is a good diagram to understand it.

F. Moving data from a non-CDB to a PDB is only possible by using conventional export and import.

[ald85]
BD
E,F ->Incorrect -> tablespace export/import can be conventional or transportable
A,C -> Nothing is created automatically you must create what you need.

[veginha]
actually tablespaces can be created automatically with full exports, that's why parameters like REMAP_DATAFILE and REUSE_DATAFILES exist in impdp. (A)
https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28319/dp_import.htm#i1010424
I think that B is incorrect since a database user and a local user is like the same, so no conversion is necessary.
And D seems to be correct since a common user must be converted, but it seems like always fails because of the "##" characters in the "create user c##common" command, so the REMAP_SCHEMA is needed.

Which four are true about a Recovery Manager (RMAN) duplication without a TARGET connection? (Choose four.)
A. The NOREDO clause must be used if the backups of the database being duplicated were taken when the database was in NOARCHIVELOG mode.
B. The UNDO TABLESPACE clause is always required when no connection exists to the TARGET instance.
C. RMAN "pushes" the backups of the database to be duplicated over the network to the auxiliary instance.
D. The NOREDO clause can be used if the backups of the database being duplicated were taken when the database was in ARCHIVELOG mode.
E. RMAN SBT-based backups of the database to be duplicated can be used by the auxiliary instance.
F. The UNDO TABLESPACE clause is always required when no connection exists to the recovery catalog and the TARGET database is closed.
G. The UNDO TABLESPACE clause is always required when no connection exists to the recovery catalog and the TARGET database is opened.
H. RMAN disk-based backups of the database to be duplicated can be used by the auxiliary instance.

[ald85]
I Think ABCF
Reference: http://oradb-srv.wlv.ac.uk/ora12c/RCMRF/rcmsynta020.htm
Therefore, you must use the NOREDO option when the source database was in NOARCHIVELOG mode when the backups were taken.
UNDO TABLESPACE tablespace_name -> Specifies the names of the tablespaces with undo segments.
This option is only required when a subset of tablespaces are being duplicated with the SKIP TABLESPACE and TABLESPACE clauses.
You must provide the list of tablespaces with undo segments in the following cases:
No connection to the target database or the recovery catalog
No connection to a recovery catalog, a connection to the target but the target database is not open.
Active database duplication with image copies uses the auxiliary net service name to copy the source database over the network to the auxiliary instance on the destination host.
Conversely, in active database duplication with backup sets, the auxiliary instance uses the target instance net service name to retrieve the source database files over the network.
Backup-based duplication uses pre-existing RMAN backups and copies.

[dacoben415lywenw]
C is not accurate.
RMAN cannot push backups without a TARGET connection, if we are talkin about active duplicate

If you are using backup-based duplication, and if the source database and auxiliary instances reside on different hosts, then you must decide how to make the backups of the source database available to the auxiliary instance.

-Dual-mode encrypted backups can be restored either transparently or by specifying a password. (C incorrect, you just need either password or wallet)
-Encrypted backups are decrypted automatically during restore and recovery, if the required decryption keys are available. Each backup set gets a separate key.
The key is stored in encrypted form in the backup piece. The backup is decrypted with keys obtained by a user-supplied password or the Oracle software keystore ( A is correct for TDE but not for password encryption, so I'm not sure about A)

And i don't know which others, i'm thinking in two of this (D, E, F)
Anyone could help?

[ald85]
I think DEF too

[klever35]
I have no other observations.

Which three are true in Oracle 19c and later releases? (Choose three.)
A. If the password file location changes, then the new location is used automatically by the Oracle Server.
B. Schema Only accounts can be granted administrator privileges.
C. All the Oracle-supplied accounts are Schema Only accounts.
D. Privilege Analysis is included in Oracle Enterprise Edition and no longer requires Database Vault.
E. Unified Auditing can be configured to audit only events that are issued indirectly by an audited user.
F. Unified Auditing can be configured to audit only events that are issued directly by an audited user.

[veginha]
BDF
You can grant administrative privileges, such as SYSOPER and SYSBACKUP, to schema-only (passwordless) accounts. (B correct)
-Privilege analysis is now available as part of Oracle Database Enterprise Edition. (D correct)
-The unified auditing top-level statements feature enables you to audit top-level user (direct user) activities in the database without collecting indirect user activity audit data. (F correct)

You have configured RMAN SBT channels to write backups to media.
You then take an RMAN backup by using this command:

RMAN> BACKUP AS COMPRESSED BACKUPSET DATABASE
  KEEP UNTIL TIME 'SYSDATA + 730'
  RESTORE POINT 'OLD_CONFIGURATION';

Which three are true? (Choose three.)
A. The restore point is a label for the system change number (SCN) that will be saved two years after the archival backup was taken.
B. The data file backups in the self-contained archive backup are not considered obsolete for two years regardless of the retention policy.
C. All archive logs created after this backup are kept for two years.
D. The SPFILE is included in the self-contaied archival backup.
E. The control file is included in the self-contained archival backup.
F. The restore point is a label for the system change number (SCN) before the archival backup was taken.

[veginha]
B,D,E are correct
The restore point is a label for the SCN to which this archival backup can be restored and recovered , and is captured just after the data file backups complete. (F is wrong)
Normal restore points are retained in the database for at least the number of days specified for the CONTROL_FILE_RECORD_KEEP_TIME initialization parameter (A incorrect)
-The control file autobackup that RMAN automatically makes when you use the backup .. keep command has a copy of the restore point (and also the spfile D and E are correct)
KEEP - Specifies the backup as an archival backup, which is a self-contained backup that is exempt from the configured retention policy.
UNTIL TIME - Specifies the time until which the backup or copy must be kept (B correct)

Which four are true about RMAN backup sets? (Choose four.)
A. A backup piece can belong to only one backup set.
B. A data file can be split into multiple sections stored in different backup sets.
C. A data file can be split into multiple sections stored in different backup pieces in the same backup set.
D. Blocks from multiple data files can be contained in one backup piece,
E. A backup set can contain only one backup piece.
F. A backup set must be written to media.
G. A backup set must be written to disk.
H. Blocks from multiple data files can be contained in one backup set,

[veginha]
ADEH seems correct to me

[ald85]
I Think ACEH (i think D and H are incompatible, I don't know)

[ald85]
You are correct. https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/backup.111/b28270/rcmcncpt.htm#BRADV89486

[julica]
If you specify the SECTION SIZE parameter on the BACKUP command, then RMAN produces a multisection backup.
This is a backup of a single large file, produced by multiple channels in parallel, each of which produces one backup piece.
Each backup piece contains one file section of the file being backed up. (not C).

B. The BACKUP DATABASE command will create a pluggable database (PDB) backup when RMAN is connected to a PDB.
C. SPFILE backups can be created while connected to an application root PDB.
D. The BACKUP DATABASE PLUS ARCHIVELOG command will back up archive logs when RMAN is connected to a PDB.
E. The BACKUP PLUGGABLE DATABASE command can be used to back up CDB$ROOT.

Examine these queries and their output:

SQL> select pdb_nama, name, pdb_restore_point, clean_pdb_restore_point
  2  from v$restore_point natural join dba_rdbs;

PDB_NAME  NAME  PDB_RESTORE_POINT  CLEAN_PDB_RESTORE_POINT
--------- ----- ------------------ ------------------------
PDB1      R1    YES                NO

SQL> select propeyty_name, propeyty_value
  2  from database_properties where property_name like '%UNDO&';

PROPERTY_NAME       PROPERTY_VALUE
------------------- ---------------
LOCAL_UNDO_ENABLED  FALSE

An online RMAN backup of the CDB was taken an hour before Restore Point R1 was created.
You want to recover PDB1 to Restore Point R1.
How do you achieve this?
A. Execute FLASHBACK PLUGGABLE DATABASE PDB1 TO RESTORE POINT R1 by using RMAN while connected to PDB1.
B. Execute FLASHBACK PLUGGABLE DATABASE PDB1 TO RESTORE POINT R1 by using SQL while connected to PDB1.
C. Execute FLASHBACK PLUGGABLE DATABASE PDB1 TO RESTORE POINT R1 by using SQL while connected to CDB$ROOT.
D. Execute FLASHBACK PLUGGABLE DATABASE PDB1 TO RESTORE POINT R1 by using RMAN while connected to CDB$ROOT.
E. This cannot be done due to the lack of a clean restore point.

[ald85]
I think E
https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/12.2/sqlrf/FLASHBACK-DATABASE.html#GUID-BE0ACF9A-BC13-4810-B08B-33326440258B
PLUGGABLE
Specify PLUGGABLE to flash back a PDB. You must specify this clause whether the current container is the root or the PDB you want to flash back.
Restrictions on Flashing Back a PDB
You cannot flash back a proxy PDB.
If the CDB is in shared undo mode, then you can only flash back a PDB to a clean PDB restore point. Refer to the CLEAN clause of CREATE RESTOREPOINT for more information.

[Reimajestic]
answer: C
When using restore points, you can perform a flashback database operation either to a CDB restore point, PDB restore point, PDB clean restore point, or PDB guaranteed restore point.

Which two are true about diagnosing Oracle Database failure situations using Data Recovery Advisor? (Choose two.)
A. Using the Data Recovery Advisor LIST FAILURE command always requires that the database for which failures are to be listed is in MOUNT state.
B. A failure can be closed only when it has been repaired.
C. Data Recovery Advisor can be used if a database is closed.
D. The Data Recovery Advisor CHANGE FAILURE command can be used only to change failure priorities.
E. Data Recovery Advisor can proactively check for failures.

[veginha]
change failure can be used to close a failure, does it count as a priority cahnge? or option D can be discarted?
option B i think is incorrect because you can close a failure even if you haven't solved it

[ald85]
I think CE

[monad2006]
I think CE also.

[taotsumiau]
Correct DE,
C- Data Recovery Advisor can be used if a database is closed. Not correct, DB should be no mount.
